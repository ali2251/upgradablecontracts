# What is trustless?

Trustless upgradability means that the user is in full control and no matter what, no one can steal users funds or alter the state without users consent. Almost all of the methods used today in the industry are fully trusted and that really sucks in a decentralised system. The point is simple, dont have contracts on the mainnet which are controlled entirely by you, use a database instead
