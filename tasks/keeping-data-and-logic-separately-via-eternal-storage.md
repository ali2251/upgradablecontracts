# Keeping data and logic separately via Eternal Storage

## Task 3

This pattern follows the same approach as the previous one, the only difference being that the storage contract is implemented in a specific way, with mappings, carry out all of the exercises from the previous task but implement the storage contract with mapping of each type.

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't have to take into account different sizes for storage such uint8, uint16 and so on, uint will suffice for now but if you wish, you can. 
{% endhint %}
