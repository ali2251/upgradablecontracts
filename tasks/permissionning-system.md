# Permissioning System

The permissioning system is the most flexible system which can be implemented in any way possible, the idea is to have a User contract and Company contract, the user contract holds the permissions for what the company is allowed to do.

## Task 4

* Implement a User contract which allows for basic permissions such as funds or adding some hash to the contract which can potentially represent some data about the user. 
* Implement the company contract which can create new User contracts and interact with the user contract.

The company contract can also be thought of a specific feature/product from a company where each of them require different permissions and the reason is justified.
